# dotfiles

Various configuration files for archlinux, shamelessly stolen from around the internet.

## How to install

1. install [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
2. clone the repository into `~/dotfiles`
3. run `stow <package>` to symlink all configuration files for that package
   into the relevant subdirectory in $HOME (e.g. `stow compton` will symlink
   `compton.conf` to `~/.config/compton.conf`
